## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Using Github for collaboration**

`Expectation`
I expected GitHub to just be a place to put my code so I could get a link.

`Reality` 
Thereâ€™s so much more things such as branches, pull requests, previewing code, deploying with GitHub Pages. It's has a lot of collaborative tools useful for developers.

`Impact`
I deployed my portfolio straight from GitHub. Seeing my changes go live with just a push felt real. Now I feel like I actually own my work.

**2. Concept: Pull Requests (PRs)**
`Expectation`
I thought pull requests were only necessary for team collaborations with formal review processes.

`Reality` 
PRs are useful even when working alone. They provide a structured way to review changes before merging, encourage cleaner code, and help keep the main branch stable.

`Impact`
I began using pull requests for all major changes in my portfolio. It helped me review updates critically and maintain a clear record of progress over time.

**3. Concept: Merge Conflicts**  
`Expectation`  
I assumed merge conflicts were something only big teams dealt with, and that theyâ€™d be extremely difficult to resolve.

`Reality`  
Merge conflicts can happen even in solo projects when changes are made on the same lines across different branches. Git provides clear markers and tools to resolve them manually.

`Impact`  
Understanding merge conflicts gave me confidence to work with multiple branches. Now, instead of fearing conflicts, I see them as part of the development process.

**4. Concept: Branching**  
`Expectation`  
I thought branches were overkill for simple personal projects and only mattered in complex, team-based development.

`Reality`  
Branches are incredibly useful for organizing changes, experimenting with new features, and avoiding accidental breakagesâ€”even when working alone.

`Impact`  
Creating feature-specific branches helped me test different designs for my portfolio without interfering with the live version. It made my workflow cleaner and more focused.


## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)
